#If you were working on an application that was rendering a page/screen very slowly, how would you go about
investigating and fixing the issue?

- find out what is causing the rendering to be slow using performance testing tools
- find which component renders the slowest
- find the component file and fix the problem

The cause can be from a variety of things:

- Not using the right components.
- Data processed on a component part is redundant.
- Data processing is not in the component part and at the right time.
- The data processing process uses inappropriate coding.
- Components always update / render when not needed.
- Excessive REST API calls.
- etc

The solution:

- Use the right component in right case
- limit data processing as needed and as efficient as possible
- make sure the data processing is in the right component at the right time
- correct the code in data processing if it is not precise and efficient
- use features to prevent re-rendering of components such as pure components or others
- make sure API calls is as needed and as small as possible so that it is not slow and heavy
