#When should you use higher order components and pure components?

#HOC is useful when you want to inject additional behaviours to the existing Component. You can use HOC to inject:
- React Lifecycle (eg. execute code in componentWillMount)
- State (eg. react-reduxâ€™s connect)
- Component (Parent Component, Child Component, Sibling Component)
- Style

#Pure Components is useful to restricts the re-rendering ensuring the higher performance of the Component.
components which do not re-renders when the value of state and props has been updated with the same values. 
If the value of the previous state or props and the new state or props is the same, 
the component is not re-rendered.

Example:

#HOC

const HOC = Comp => ({children, ...props}) => (
  <Comp {...props}>
    {children}
  </Comp>
)

const CompWithHOC = HOC(List)

#Pure Component

import React, { memo } from 'react';

class ContactList extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    const { contacts } = this.props;
    return <List data={contacts} />;
  }
}
