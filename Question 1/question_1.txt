#What is the difference between Props vs State?

#Props
Props are used to pass data from one component to another. Props cannot be modified, read-only, and Immutable.

#State
State represents parts of an Application that can change. Each component can have its State. The state is Mutable and It is local to the component only.

Example:

#Props:

> App Parent

import Childern from './Childern'
function App() {
    
  const children=
    {
    name:"Julian",
    class:"2nd"
    }
  
  return (
    <View>
      <Childern children={children} />
    </View>
  );
}
  
export default App;

> Childern Component
  
const Childern =(props) =>{
  
   return(
       <View>
           <Text>List of Children</Text>
           <Text>Name: {props.children.name}</Text>
           <Text>Class: {props.children.class}</Text>
       </View>  
   )
}
  
export default Childern;
